This project is to write a program in Python 3 to move files in a directory and
their associated permissions to AWS Cloud.




There will be 3 steps to this project:

  Step 1: Obtaining all the file names and permissions in a .txt file
    
    This step will be written in Python 3.
    - The user will input a Directory Path
    - The program will loop through all the files and folders in that directory using Depth First Search (DFS) principles
    - The program will create a .txt file with the name of each file/folder, the permissions associated, and "ENTRY END\n" at the end of each new file/folder entry
    - Special Permissions will not be accounted for (Subject to Change)
   
For instance, for a Directory as such:

Folder 1
  File 1.1
  File 1.2
Folder 2
  File 2.2

The .txt file may appear as such:

Folder: Folder 1
Group: [Group 1]
Permission: [Permission 1]
Permission: [Permission 2]
Group: [Group 2]
Permission: [Permission 1]
ENTRY END


  Step 2: Copying all the files to AWS Cloud
  Step 3: Interpreting the .txt file from Step 1 and setting up the permissions in AWS Cloud accordingly
