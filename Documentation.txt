This project is to write a program in Python 3 to move files in a directory and
their associated permissions to AWS Cloud.


There will be 3 steps to this project:

  Step 1: Obtaining all the file names and permissions in a .txt file
    
    This step will be written in Python 3.
    - The user will input a Directory Path
    - The program will loop through all the files and folders in that directory using Depth First Search (DFS) principles
    - The program will create a .txt file with the name of each file/folder, the permissions associated, and "ENTRY END\n" at the end of each new file/folder entry
    - Special Permissions will not be accounted for (Subject to Change)
   
For instance, for a Directory as such:

Folder 1
  File 1.1
  File 1.2
Folder 2
  File 2.1

The .txt file may appear as such:

Depth: 0
File: Folder 1
Group: [Group 1]
Permission: [Permission 1]
Permission: [Permission 2]
Group: [Group 2]
Permission: [Permission 1]
ENTRY END

Depth: 1
File: File 1.1
Group: [Group 1]
Permission: [Permission 1]
ENTRY END

Depth: 1
File: File 1.2
Group: [Group 1]
Permission: [Permission 1]
ENTRY END

Depth: 0
File: Folder 2
Group: [Group 1]
Permission: [Permission 1]
ENTRY END

Depth: 1
File: File 2.1
Group: [Group 1]
Permission: [Permission 1]
ENTRY END


  Step 2: Copying all the files to AWS Cloud
    
    This step will either be manual select all, copy, and paste to AWS Cloud or done with Python depending if the first method is possible/feasible.
  
  
  Step 3: Interpreting the .txt file from Step 1 and setting up the permissions in AWS Cloud accordingly
    
    This step will be done using Python 3.
